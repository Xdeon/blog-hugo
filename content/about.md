## About me

I finished my graduate study at the [Department of Computer Science, University of Saskatchewan, Canada](https://www.cs.usask.ca). My research focuses on utilizing concurrency-oriented programming language such as [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org)/[Go](https://golang.org) to build infrastructure for the Internet of Things protocols like [CoAP](https://coap.technology). You can find my thesis [here](https://harvest.usask.ca/handle/10388/9710).

Previously I was involved in electrical engineering and had some experience related to IC/FPGA design and industrial automation. I am also a MOOC fan, being active on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) and [edX](https://www.edx.org) recently.
