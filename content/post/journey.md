It has been a long time since I posted something last time.

A lot of things happened to me. I didn't see them coming. In short, I messed up. Till now I suffer from depression and anxiety from time to time. I felt so hard to move on, especially when it comes to the fact that I used to have the chance to do better. 

However, thanks to god I still have someone supporting me all the time. Without them I can not imagine what I would look like today. 

I've wasted too much time wondering and regretting. The problem I've been facing has not gone yet. But one thing so important and I forgot long ago, is that only by practicing can one really grab the chance to change. 

So I decided to start over. I've been on the track of [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) for a while. And this is my [board of progress](https://trello.com/b/dbAEsqL7/xdeon-ossu-compsci). The [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/) series on Coursera helps me a lot, too. 

Is it too late to do so? It might be. But I really don't want anything like "If I do this earlier" on my "list of regrets" any more. 

Good luck to me and all my beloved who are also on a journey.
